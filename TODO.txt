add timer (each guess) + scoring (time based) per session, not saved locally
make the random selection better
    - favor countries who haven't been chosen for x rounds
    - impossible to reroll the same country within (5?) rounds
    - second list of songs? chooses randomly between 1 and 2, then picks a song from whichever
add more countries (yt video has every country, use that probably?)
fix bug where pressing space while creating a username calls checkGuess()
